The PPE detection model (best.pt) used in this project is sourced from the GitHub repository [Construction-Site-Safety-PPE-Detection](https://github.com/snehilsanyal/Construction-Site-Safety-PPE-Detection) by Snehil Sanyal. The original model was trained on a dataset of 2,801 images annotated with 10 PPE-related classes. In this implementation, only a subset of the classes—specifically 'Hardhat', 'Mask', and 'Safety Vest'—are used for detection purposes.
